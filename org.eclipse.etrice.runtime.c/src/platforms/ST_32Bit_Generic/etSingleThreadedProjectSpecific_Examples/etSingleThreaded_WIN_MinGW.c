/*******************************************************************************
 * This file implements the project specific part of teh single threaded
 * runtime for a XMC ARM Cortex microcontroller from Infineon.
 *
 * It demonstrates how to adapt to your specific microcontroller. The only thing
 * you need is a periodic interrupt which maintains the etTime. This is the base
 * for all the modeltimers you can use in your eTrice model.
 *
 * This implementation gives you a 1ms accurate time. For most applications this
 * resolution is sufficient and the implementation is much simpler. This version
 * could serve as a starting point for your own project with any other microcontroller.
